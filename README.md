# ArtesiaRocket
Repository of (eventually) open-source model rocket components. Shares a name with an area of Port Canaveral [before it was Port Canaveral](http://www.cityofcapecanaveral.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7BFCF82651-D0DA-4BE5-B512-1652A96826AE%7D).

# Current Build
At present, we modify a base Estes kit with 3d-printed parts. Future editions should be mostly 3d printed or self contained, but there will always be some [vitamins](http://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Vitamin) in need of collection.

## Bill of Materials
* 1 x [Estes EX-200 kit](http://www.estesrockets.com/rockets/rtf/002450-ex-200tm)
* 1 x Paraboloid Nose Cone model from physibles/18mm
* 1 x Body Tube 18mmx130mm model from physibles/18mm
* 1 x Body Tube 18mmx50mm model from physibles/18mm
* 1 x Body Tube Coupler with hook model from physibles/18mm

## Printing Pointers
Use callipers to measure your filament diameter. Underextrusion/overextrusion will KILL some of these prints. Print at 100% infill for body tubes, make sure you have good cooling and a SLOW extrusion rate (30mm/s is the our max). For nose cones, smaller infill is better, we use 20%. Complex parts like couplers and nosecones with hooks need support material. Sand all parts to be as smooth as you can get them, especially areas where support material was removed.
